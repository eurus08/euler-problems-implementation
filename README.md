# euler-problems-implementation

This repo contain my implementation of the Euler Problem published by [Project Euler dotnet](https://projecteuler.net/archives) using the C Language.

**Note:**
* These implementation avoids the use of arrays when possible to save memory
* Algorithms used in these implementation may not be the most efficient but should be able to find the results in reasonable time.
* Problem are treated as independent projects (with difference main functions).
