# Euler Problem 2
## Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2 then the first 10 terms will be: $1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\cdots$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


### Solution
The nth term of the Fibonacci Sequence is given as $F_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$. Hence to find the nth term, we would have to find all previous $n-1$ terms. 

we can use a recursive function for this purpose.

However we don't which $n$ would generate all Fibonacci terms less than 4 million.

To cater for this we need to check this condition with every new term we create. Hence we cannot write an algorithm to create the nth term Fibonacci but an algorithm that continually create fibonnaci numbers. 

#### Algorithm: Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers Below 4,000,000

**Input:** None  
**Output:** The sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than 4,000,000.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize:
   - `x_i ← 1` (first Fibonacci number)
   - `x_j ← 2` (second Fibonacci number)
   - `fib ← 2` (current Fibonacci number)
   - `sum ← 0`
2. While `fib < 4,000,000`, do:
   - If `fib` is even, then:
     - Add `fib` to `sum`.
   - Compute the next Fibonacci number:  
     `fib ← x_j + x_i`
   - Update previous values:
     - `x_i ← x_j`
     - `x_j ← fib`
3. Output `sum`.
